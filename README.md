# Book Classification and Analysis using MobileNetV2 with Smoothing and Thresholding Techniques

The rapid growth of the book industry means that it has become even harder to manage the sheer amount of books being produced each year. If done manually, this is tedious and very time-consuming. Hence this study developed a hybrid system integrating MobileNetV2-based image classification with OCR text extraction for automated book categorization. Using a dataset of 2,948 processed book cover images from Kaggle, the MobileNetV2 CNN was trained to distinguish between “Normal” and “Anime/Comic” categories. The model achieved a precision of 0.8295, recall of 0.7374, F1-score of 0.7807, and mAP of 0.8638 over 31 training epochs, with validation accuracy stabilizing at around 85-87%. OCR processing enabled automatic extraction of book titles, with results stored in CSV format for cataloging.
